## Description
 

This project analyzes the Carbon dioxide emissions produced from global shipping focusing on understanding the impact of these emissions on climate and the rising sea levels. Shipping alone accounts for approximately 3% of global greenhouse emissions where CO2 is used as the baseline for measuring the global warming potential (GWP) of greenhouse gases due to its GWP of 1 over all time horizons.

Although the warming effect of CO2 per molecule is lower than that of gases like Methane, its significant atmospheric concentration and long atmospheric lifetime make it the primary driver of anthropogenic climate change. The extended presence of CO2 in the atmosphere means that its emissions can influence the climate for centuries, highlighting the critical importance of addressing CO2 emissions within the transport sector to mitigate long-term climate impacts.
