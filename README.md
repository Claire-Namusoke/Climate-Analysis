# CLIMATE ANALYSIS ON CO2 EMISSIONS IN THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
This project analyzes the Carbon dioxide emissions produced by activities within the transport sector , both domestically and internationally in various countries. The focus is on understanding the impact of these emissions on climate and the environment. The transport sector is a significant contributor to global gas emissions , with shipping alone accounting for approximately 3% of global greenhouse emissions. CO2 is used as the baseline for measuring the global warming potential (GWP) of greeenhouse gases due to its GWP of 1 over all time horizons. Although the warming effect of CO2 per molecule is lower than that of gases like Methane, its significant atmospheric concetratration and long atmospheric lifetime make it the primary driver of anthropogenic climate change. The extended presence of CO2 in the atmosphere means that its emissions can influence the climate for centuries , highlighting the critical importance of addressing CO2 emissions within the transport sector to mitigate long- term climate impacts.
