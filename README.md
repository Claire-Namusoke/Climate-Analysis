## Description

This project retrieves temperature anomaly data (1901-2024) from the World Bank's Climate Change Knowledge Portal and saves it for analysis. The data includes historical temperature measurements across global countries using the CRU TS4.09 dataset.

his project analyzes the Carbon dioxide emissions produced from global shipping focusing on understanding the impact of these emissions on climate and the environment. Shipping alone accounts for approximately 3% of global greenhouse emissions where CO2 is used as the baseline for measuring the global warming potential (GWP) of greenhouse gases due to its GWP of 1 over all time horizons.

Although the warming effect of CO2 per molecule is lower than that of gases like Methane, its significant atmospheric concentration and long atmospheric lifetime make it the primary driver of anthropogenic climate change. The extended presence of CO2 in the atmosphere means that its emissions can influence the climate for centuries, highlighting the critical importance of addressing CO2 emissions within the transport sector to mitigate long-term climate impacts.

Dataset
"This dataset provides monthly estimates of CO₂ emissions from international maritime transport by country of departure and vessel type. It covers emissions linked to international shipping based on AIS tracking data and fuel use estimation methods..."
